# About me
---
Hey!<br>
I'm an Electronics graduate from Manipal Institute of Technology. I work on trying to make computers smarter or at least comparable to humans for a living. Aside from that, I'd like to think I'm a decent photogrpaher.<br> 
Currently working as a Project Assistant at Video Analytics Lab, Indian Institute of Science.
