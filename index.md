# About me

<font size="-1">Hello there!<br>

As a Robotics student at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, I'm on a mission to create machines that could potentially rival our own intelligence. My research focuses on upcoming topics like multi-view geometry, 3D meshes, and egocentric vision, working alongside <a href="https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~hspark/">Prof. Hyun Soo Park</a>.<br><br>

Before that, I spent time at the Robert Bosch Center for Cyber Physical Systems, working on exciting challenges like warehouse automation for AGVs, vision-aided teleoperation for manipulators, and visual SLAM for quadrupeds with <a href="https://shishirny.github.io/">Dr. Shishir N. Y</a> and <a href="https://aml.ece.iisc.ac.in/index.php/Bharadwaj_Amrutur">Prof. Bharadwaj Amrutur</a>. I've also honed my skills in object detection, depth estimation, and computational photography during my time with <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/">Prof. Venkatesh Babu</a>.<br><br>

And when I'm not working, I'm indulging in my passions for photography, music, and film.
